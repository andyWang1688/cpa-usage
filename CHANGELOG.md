# Changelog

## 0.3.3

- Extract the sliding segmented control into a shared component; the hour/day/month switcher now slides like the range picker (it was an instant swap before).
- Speed up chart animations (450ms, ease-out).

## 0.3.2

- Enable the shadcn animation layer (`tw-animate-css`) so existing `animate-in` / `fade-in` / `slide-in` classes actually work; re-enable chart animations (recharts was hard-disabled) and add light staggered entrance animations for the metric grid, chart and detail cards.

## 0.3.1

- Dashboard now reuses the CPA management panel session (same-origin secure storage, the standard approach used by CPA plugins) instead of asking for the management key. When the session is unavailable it shows guidance to log in to the management center with "remember password" enabled.

## 0.3.0

- **Plugin store compliance**: dynamic API endpoints (`/api/usage`, `/api/health`, `/api/collect`) now register as authenticated management routes under `/v0/management/plugins/usage-report/api/...` instead of the unauthenticated `/v0/resource/plugins/...` prefix. The dashboard asks for the CPA management key on first use and stores it in the browser (localStorage).
- Release builds now cover all five plugin-store platforms: darwin arm64/amd64, linux amd64/arm64, windows amd64.

## 0.2.3

- fix: plugin configuration (`db_path`) was never applied when the host delivered the payload wrapped in a `result` envelope; the plugin silently fell back to its built-in default path. Both payload shapes are now handled, and the default path is `~/.cli-proxy-api/usage-report.sqlite`.

## 0.2.2

- Dashboard "更新于" (updated at) now reflects the freshness timestamp of each refresh instead of the last received request time, so it no longer looks frozen during idle periods.

## 0.2.1

- Dashboard: drop the obsolete standalone-service settings dialog, the "sync usage" button and the terminal setup notice; the page auto-refreshes and the footer shows the plugin version.
- Frontend: build with `base: "./"` and relative API paths so assets resolve from the plugin resource route.
- Release: the plugin version is injected at build time (`-ldflags -X main.version=$VERSION`).

## 0.2.0

- Rework the project into a CLIProxyAPI native plugin (`plugin/`): usage collected in real time via the `usage.handle` callback; dashboard and data API served inside the CPA process via `management_api`.
- Publish installable releases through the plugin store (`plugin-store/registry.json`); one-click install from the CPA management panel.
- Automated multi-platform plugin builds on tag (darwin/arm64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64) with `checksums.txt`.
- Dashboard assets are built from `frontend/` and embedded into the plugin.
- Remove the former standalone Python service (`report.py`, `cli.py`, `install.sh` and related tests/scripts); the plugin replaces it.

## 0.1.1

- Default application home is now `~/.cpa-usage/`.
- Add `cpa-usage migrate` for legacy installations, preserving configuration, SQLite history, logs and versions; rebuild the virtual environment and restart safely.
- Refuse existing migration targets, preserve custom directories and external databases, and restore the old service on failed startup.
- Emphasize local-first storage and lightweight, single-process operation in the dashboard and documentation.

## 0.1.0

- Real shadcn/ui dashboard with calendar ranges, stacked trend, model filtering and anonymized key/request tables.
- Local SQLite collector; fix out-of-order buckets, inclusive end dates, zero-token request counts and hidden collector errors.
- Versioned, checksummed release installation and command-line service management.
- Update preserves configuration/database and rolls back the program on failed startup.
- Automated tests and prebuilt releases on macOS/Linux CI.
